# Stock Data Analysis with Python 📈

This project involves analyzing stock market data using Python. I used libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `yfinance` to fetch, clean, and visualize historical stock data.

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Retrieve stock data using the `yfinance` API
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize price trends and volume traded over time
- Gain insights into stock performance (e.g., Apple, AMD)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- yfinance
- pandas
- matplotlib

## 📂 Files in this Repository
- `Python_final_project.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook with all the code and visualizations
- `README.md`: This file

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `stock_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run each cell in order

## 🔗 Data Source
- [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) via `yfinance` Python package
